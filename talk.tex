\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{My Project}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Working towards a Ph.D. in Biostatistics
    \item Looking to explain the interaction between day-of-cycle, age, and time-to-menopause
      observed in the changes to reproductive hormone profiles expressed during
      the menopausal transition.
    \item Aim 1: `Parsimonious B-Spline Regression Model via Control Polygon Reduction'
    \item I've developed a novel method selection approach for enumeration and
      placement of knots for B-splines.  
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Why I Needed A HPC}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulations to show how CPR compared to
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A standard likelihood-based forward-step model selection approach,
        \item A standard likelihood-based backward-step model selection apprach,
        \item P-splines
      \end{itemize}
    \item Metrics:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item likelihood and/or Root Mean Squared Error by degrees of freedom,
        \item computation time.
      \end{itemize} 

    \item Start with $L$ internal knots:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item CPR requires $L + 1$ regression fits,
        \item Forward-step requires $L + 1$ regression fits,
        \item Backward-step requires $L(L+1)/2 + 1$ regression fits,
        \item P-splines requires $L + 1$ regressino fits.
      \end{itemize}

    \item For $L = 50$ a total of 1,429 regression models to fit.
      
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Why I Needed A HPC}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Moving Parts:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Four functions.
        \item Modeling under ordinary least squares and under mixed effect models.
        \item Differing sample sizes, model, and subject specific errors.
      \end{itemize}
    \item 144 sets of initial conditions.
    \item Required time to run the $1,429$ regression models for each set of
      inputs: between 00:15 and 03:30.
    \item 1,000 data sets to be generate for each set of initial conditions.  
    \item $205,776,000$ total regression models to fit.
    \item I need a lot of computing cores.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{My HPC Pipline}
  \framesubtitle{Hardware, Software, Disk and RAM Usage}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A lot of computation cores
      \end{itemize}

    \item Software
      \begin{itemize}
        \item SLURM
        \item R
        \item tar
      \end{itemize}

    \item RAM
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Less than 6 GB per core.
        \item Low enough that the 128GB per Rosliand node was sufficient to
          support 20 parallel simulations per node.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Disk Space
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Less than 2 GB, tarballs total 633 MB.
        \item A lot of small files where generated.
        \item Originally only had 50,000 inode limit on {\tt \$HOME} and
          {\tt \$SCRATCH}, extended to 100,000 inode limit.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Difficulties}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Files.
      \begin{itemize} 
        \item Solution: generate a controlled number of files and place into a
          tarball for each set of initial conditions.
      \end{itemize}

    \item[]

    \item Getting a Job to run to completion.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Option 1: Request lots of nodes and cores.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Use GNU parallel to manage the run.
            \item Did not work well for me.
            \item Queue time for resources was high.
            \item Getting a good estimate for the time required to run the sim
              was difficult. (More on this later.)
          \end{itemize}
        \item Option 2: Use SLURM Arrays to request a few resources many times.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item This worked well for me.
            \item Lower queue time.
            \item Leaves more resourse open for others.
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Estimating Time Need For An Iteration}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Differences between my desktop and Rosliand
      \begin{tabular}{lll}
            & Rosliand                                  & My Desktop \\ \hline
